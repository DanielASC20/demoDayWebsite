            Hello there, we are young computer science students
            of All Star Code. Our names are Abhi Pendyala, 
            Daniel Torres, Francky Duperval, and Zidane Thomas. 
            We have been in All Star Code from July to August of 
            2020. We have been taught many things in the languages 
            of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Through this program, we've learned 
            various things about website building, Graphic Design, 
            along with animation. We're all sad that our time with the program
            is coming to and end but are greatful for everything we
            were able to learn from it.
